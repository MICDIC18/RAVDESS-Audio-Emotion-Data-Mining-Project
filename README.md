# RAVDESS-Audio-Emotion-Data-Mining-Project


This repository contains the final project developed for the Data Mining 1 university course.
The project focuses on emotion recognition and data analysis using the RAVDESS (Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song) dataset.

Project Structure
- Dataset/ → Contains the preprocessed CSV file (ravdess_features.csv) with extracted audio features.
- Notebooks/ → Includes Jupyter notebooks for data understanding, clustering, classification, and association rule mining.
- report_dm1.pdf → Final project report describing methodology, results, and conclusions.

The analysis applies several Data Mining and Machine Learning techniques:
- Data understanding and preprocessing
- Clustering (K-Means, Hierarchical)
- Classification (Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Random Forest)
- Association Rule Mining (Apriori algorithm)

The goal of this project is to analyze the acoustic features of the RAVDESS dataset and classify emotional states expressed in speech.
The study aims to identify patterns and correlations between sound properties and emotional tone using machine learning techniques.
